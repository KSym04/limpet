# SPEC — security + Windows hardening (v0.7.3)

Two parallel audits (adversarial security, Windows correctness) plus a
`cargo audit` advisory scan (clean, 123 deps). The security audit's headline:
`import` was a second, UNGUARDED write path into the store. The Windows
audit's headline: `canonicalize()` yields `\\?\` verbatim paths that break
the `/`-based index for every subdirectory, and CI never caught it because
tests use non-canonicalized `TempDir` roots.

## Security: consolidate import behind remember's guards

`import_jsonl` treats `.limpet/memory.jsonl` as UNTRUSTED (it arrives via
`git pull`). It now enforces what `remember` enforces:

- **Secrets rejected.** Body and evidence scanned via `secrets::detect`; a
  credential-bearing line is counted in `ImportReport.rejected`, never
  inserted. Restores the secrets.rs invariant on the import path.
- **Future timestamps rejected.** A `9999-...` `updated_at` would win the LWW
  merge against every honest later update forever; future or unparseable
  stamps are rejected.
- **Bounded line reads** (1 MiB) — no OOM from one giant line.
- **Confidence clamped** to [0,1] — an imported `1e300` can no longer pin a
  hostile memory to the top of recall.
- **Body size capped** at `MAX_BODY_BYTES` (64 KiB), enforced on both the
  remember and import paths.
- **Anchor hashes re-resolved** against the LOCAL index: a forged
  `ast_body_hash` cannot fake freshness against code this machine lacks.

Other security fixes:
- Updater caps the download at 128 MiB (OOM before checksum).
- Secret detector splits on `@` and `/` (catches `user:pass@host` shapes).
- Documented residual, by-design: the updater checksum is same-origin, not a
  signature; a compromised release is out of scope until signed builds (1.0).

## Windows: the verbatim-path root cause

- `util::canonicalize_plain` strips the `\\?\` (and `\\?\UNC\`) prefix;
  `root_from`, `install`, and `doctor` use it so stored roots join cleanly
  with `/`-separated rels.
- `util::normalize_rel` converts `\` to `/` at every tool boundary (anchors,
  `map` target, recall `working_set`) so a Windows agent's `src\foo.rs`
  matches the walker's `/`-keyed rows.
- `doctor` freshness compares canonically (verbatim/case/separator safe), so
  a correct Windows install no longer FAILs.
- `install` registers a non-verbatim command (spawnable by Claude Code).
- `validate_rel_path` rejects Windows reserved device names (NUL/CON/COM1...)
  now that a non-verbatim root would honor them.
- `uninstall` prints the real data dir (APPDATA\limpet), not a Unix path.

## INVARIANTS

- I-S1: no write path (remember OR import) admits a secret, an over-cap body,
  or an out-of-range confidence.
- I-S2: an imported anchor's freshness is judged against local code, never a
  self-asserted hash.
- I-W1: a repo-relative path round-trips identically regardless of the
  caller's separator or the platform's canonical form.

## Task Implementation Checklist

- [x] store.rs import_jsonl: secrets/future/bounds/clamp/anchor-reresolve;
      ImportReport.rejected
- [x] memory/mod.rs: MAX_BODY_BYTES on the remember path
- [x] update.rs: capped download
- [x] secrets.rs: @ / split
- [x] util.rs: canonicalize_plain, normalize_rel, reserved-device check
- [x] main.rs: root_from/install/doctor canonicalize_plain; uninstall wording
- [x] tools.rs: normalize anchors, map target, working_set
- [x] tests: import rejects secret/future/clamp; anchor re-resolve; oversize
      body; normalize_rel; backslash validation
- [x] cargo audit clean; 87 tests green; bench holds; import-secret dogfood
- [ ] PR -> CI (incl. windows-latest) -> merge -> tag v0.7.3 -> pipeline
